# Speech_Summarization

Welcome to my GitHub repository on Speech Summarization! This project aims to leverage Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques to summarize spoken content into concise and coherent text summaries. The implementation is done using Python and Jupyter Notebook, providing an interactive and easy-to-follow environment for experimenting with the code.

üîç Features and Highlights:

Speech-to-Text Conversion: Utilizing popular speech recognition libraries, this project converts audio input into textual form, laying the groundwork for summarization.

Text Preprocessing: Cleaning and processing the extracted text to enhance the quality of summarization and remove any unnecessary noise.

Text Summarization Algorithms: Implementing state-of-the-art NLP techniques, including Extractive and Abstractive summarization, to generate concise summaries from the transcribed speech.

Evaluation Metrics: Assessing the performance of the summarization models using evaluation metrics like ROUGE (Recall-Oriented Understudy for Gisting Evaluation) to measure the quality of generated summaries.

User-Friendly Jupyter Notebook: The code and implementation are well-documented within the Jupyter Notebook, making it easy to understand and reproduce the results.
